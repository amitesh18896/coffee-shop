# Project 1

This project is intended to exercise everything we have learned in class up to (excluding) JavaScript. The task is to implement a multi-page static website without using any third-party libraries, toolkits, templates, or existing code. A design may be created from scratch or adapted from any website/theme/template available online (but no code may be reused from any source: not your own, not a library or toolkit, not an existing website, not a template).
 
The content may be anythingâ€”a fictitious business website, a personal website for yourself, a website for an organization you belong to, etc. Alternatively, you may clone an existing website (recreate a site that already exists). Think about your site content, layout, pages, design (read chapter 18 in our book).
